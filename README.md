# 🚗 Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. The model is integrated into a **Streamlit web application**, enabling customers and sales representatives to get real-time car price estimates in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## 🧪 Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Processing
- Combine and structure raw data from multiple cities
- Handle missing values and inconsistent formats (e.g., "70 kms" → `70`)
- Encode categorical variables (Label/One-Hot Encoding)
- Normalize numerical features (Min-Max/Standard Scaler)
- Detect and handle outliers using IQR or Z-score

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Visualize trends with scatter plots, box plots, histograms, and heatmaps
- Select key features based on correlation, domain knowledge, and feature importance

### 3️⃣ Model Development
- Split data into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20)
- Train multiple models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Use evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
- Compare models to select the best-performing one

### 5️⃣ Optimization
- Apply feature engineering and regularization (L1/L2) to boost performance
- Fine-tune final model for deployment

### 6️⃣ Deployment
- Build a **Streamlit** web app to serve the model
- Create an intuitive interface for users to input car details and receive predicted prices
- Implement error handling and user guidance in the app
